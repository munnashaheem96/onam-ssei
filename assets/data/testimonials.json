    "text": "Armadam 2024, proudly hosted by the 2021–2024 batch, was more than just the first grand Onam celebration — it was the most remarkable program ever conducted in the history of Sri Shanmugha College. The event brought together vibrant pookalam designs, the graceful beauty of Thiruvathira dance, energetic cultural performances, thrilling games, and the sweet delight of payasam, creating an atmosphere of pure joy and celebration. What set Armadam apart was the unity it inspired — every student’s active involvement and the wholehearted support of the management turned this vision into an unforgettable reality. Armadam 2024 will be remembered as the benchmark for all future events in our college.",
